# NFI Compilation
This project intends to reproduce some of the compilation procedures described in the Compilation Document of the National Forestry Inventory (NFI) of Canada. 
It started based on a research project from the Carbon Accounting Team to validate CBM estimates against plot data and is available to be incorporated in future work.

The ultimate goal is to contribute this repo as a submodule (or similar) to a larger repositorium containing all compilation procedures described in the Compilation Document of NFI.

This module is being developed by Vinicius Manvailer of the Carbon Accounting Team and currently contains two main components:
(1)  A hierarchical modelling approach is used to model the height of trees with broken tops. 
(2)  An approach to implement Taper Volume equations following Kozak 1997 (Used in BC).
