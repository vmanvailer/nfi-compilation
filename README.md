# nfi-compilation-volume
This project intends to reproduce the compilation procedures described in the Compilation Document of the National Forestry Inventory (NFI) of Canada. 
It is one portion of the compilation procedure that started based on research project needs.

The ultimate goal is to contribute this repo as a submodule (or similar) to a larger repositorium containing all compilation procedures described in the Compilation Document of NFI.

This module is being developed by Vinicius Manvailer of the Carbon Accounting Team.
